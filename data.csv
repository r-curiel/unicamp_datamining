conversations    I m serious  In the early days of facebook Mark Zuckerburg would wander into the company bathrooms and if he noticed someone sitting down in the stalls he would pop his head over and try to talk to them about their projects  Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out   Everyone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated   That all stopped when Michael Moritz  legendary silicon valley investor  and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders  was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding  He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that s when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how s the diligence coming along   Michael Moritz  not one to mince words  was apoplectic   GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER   Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted  because he really loved intimate poop conversations  Aw c mon Michael  it s silicon valley   Zuckerburg then withdrew after Moritz flung his cellphone into his eye socket    30 minutes later  Mark was in a very import meeting  where he banned questions about his black eye  when Moritz walked into the conference room   Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg  OUT   As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg  at the time Moritz was the bigger deal  and they all scurried out of the room   Zuckerburg  however  is not one to be intimated by anyone  Not the Winkewoz twins  not Eduardo Savarn  not Peter Thiel  and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz  Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice  but Michael Moritz was having none of that  Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR nightmare  and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued  which would have been a catastrophe for the company   Zuckerburg pretended to arbitrate  Ok fine  but you need to give me a good reason  because if it were normal  there would be no problem    Moritz was flabberghasted at this response  Was this a serious question  He answered with the most obvious answer  Because     it s not FUCKING NORMAL    Unknown to Moritz  Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall  and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands  Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage  but Zuckerburg was a master strategist   Zuckerburg went for the pounce   Okay  I ll lets write out an agreement  in writing I ll rescind the policy because it s not normal   Moritz was dumbfounded  but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders  afterall he was also an early investor in Apple  and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs  Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence   When Moritz left  a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg s face     Not Normal  eh    Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh  Ever since then  Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life long crusade to normalize poop conversations   He had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this  His advisors would tell him it s impossible  but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list  From normalizing smart phone use on the toilet  actually a collaboration between Mark Zuckerburg and Steve Jobs   to trusting Mark with their private photos  to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy   In 2015  Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall  having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap  That s when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus  and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality  If he could coax people into having life like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality  then doing it in the real world wouldn t be too big of a leap   Do you read facebook or instagram while you re pooping  Ever consider what urges you to do that  It s not your personal preference  it s by Mark Zuckerburg s design   Zuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized   Mark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop   Are you going to let him   https   i imgur com KVq4mMF jpg  EDIT  UPDATE  I just got this in my DM     I am a ex Facebook worker  Everything you said rings true  I speak to you at the risk of consequences for breaking my NDA  When I was at Facebook I was involved in a program called Project PooPal  Mark Zuckerburg was planning on Meta entering the exploding tele therapy space  but targeting people who are not ready to talk to an actual person  You talk to a virtual reality therapist who responds with what is described as the greatest AI  though whatever you tell it  it only responds with  wow  tell me more    The thing is  the virtual reality assistant has a striking resemblance to Mark Zuckerburg himself  But the most damning aspect is that it s supposed to used only when you re pooping  This feature is described as optional  though uses the most advanced AI for your phone camera to check if you re actually on a toilet  and if not  says  It looks like you re not pooping  Please start pooping and try again   I always wondered what is the purpose and origin of the project  Now I know ,,Biotechnology

166szg1jylq0po,166szg1,jylq0po,Hrmbee,2023-09-01 01:13:08,,,73.0,,Sections from the article    Today  404 Media reported on a letter sent on August 10 to the US Copyright Office by Ryland Hawkins of Author Services Inc  The company  its website and letterhead say  represents the  literary  theatrical  and musical works of L  Ron Hubbard  the late founder of Scientology  Author Services  according to records archived via the WayBackMachine  is owned by the Chuch of Spiritual Technology  which describes itself as a church within Scientology     The letter addresses Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  DMCA   which  makes it unlawful to circumvent technological measures used to prevent unauthorized access to copyrighted works   The Scientology group s letter seeks to alter exemptions granted for self repairing some consumer electronics  like video game consoles  laptops  home appliances  and farming tractors     Author Services  letter argues that while that exemption works for the  many consumer devices  that include  unilateral  shrink wrap  licenses governing the terms of use of the software   they shouldn t apply to devices that  can only be purchased and used by someone who possess  sic  particular qualifications or has been specifically trained in the use of the device   With those products  the license agreement is  negotiated and agreed to in advance  of purchase and may include restrictions that are critical to  safe and proper  device usage     The Scientology tied group seeks an amendment to the exemption so that it doesn t apply to software powered devices that can only be purchased by someone with particular qualifications or training or that use software  governed by a license agreement negotiated and executed  before purchase     Before we get into what horse the Church of Scientology could have in the right to repair race  let s consider whether its amendment is extreme      It s a totally unreasonable proposal   Elizabeth Chamberlain  director of sustainability at iFixit  told Ars Technica   I can imagine manufacturers using the presence of a  quick start  guide for a product as evidence that their consumers are  specially trained in use of the device  and thus denying broad access to repair      She noted that such an amendment would render the proposed exemptions for commercial and industrial equipment from right to repair activists  toothless             If this letter is indeed about E meters  the only electronic device Scientology is readily connected to  then Author Services may be concerned about how the Church of Scientology s reputation could be impacted if E Meters are dissected      My hunch is that the Scientologists think granting the hacking community permission to dig into their E Meter software will expose the whole operation as snake oil  The request is like so many other anti Right to Repair arguments  Manufacturers are afraid that access to repair materials will expose some of their other dirty secrets   Chamberlain said     Nathan Proctor  US Public Interest Research Group s senior director  told 404 Media that Author Services  requested DMCA changes would prevent people from repairing products with end user license agreements  EULAs   E Meters have EULAs  404 Media reported  that block ordinary people from getting into critical software and require an International Association of Scientologists membership number to update E meter software     Regardless of how an organization representing the works of the creator of Scientology ended up in the Copyright Office s mailbox  right to repair advocates say the amendment would harm the movement that would extend past electropsychometers if it were ever implemented   This was an unexpected twist in the right to repair journey that we ve been on over the past while  The hypothesis that it s the  e meters  that they re concerned with is a likely one  and as noted in the article has the potential to impact the rights to repair for far more than their devices  If policymakers are wise  they will disregard this narrowminded and self interested letter and think more broadly to the benefits that this kind of policy will bring to society as a whole ,,Business
